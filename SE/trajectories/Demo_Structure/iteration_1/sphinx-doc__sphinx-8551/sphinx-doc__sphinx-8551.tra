Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n:type: and :rtype: gives false ambiguous class lookup warnings\n**Describe the bug**\r\nThe implicit xrefs created by the info fields ``:type:`` and ``:rtype:`` seems to do lookup differently than explicit xref roles. For unqualified names it seems like they search for the name in every (sub)module instead of in the current module and then parent modules.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```rst\r\n.. py:class:: mod.A\r\n.. py:class:: mod.submod.A\r\n\r\n.. py:function:: f()\r\n\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.A`\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.submod.A`\r\n\r\n\t:param mod.A a:\r\n\t:param mod.submod.A b:\r\n\t:rtype: mod.A\r\n\t:rtype: mod.submod.A\r\n\r\n.. py:currentmodule:: mod\r\n\r\n.. py:function:: f()\r\n\r\n\t- :py:class:`A`\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.A`\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.submod.A`\r\n\r\n\t:param A a:\r\n\t:param mod.A b:\r\n\t:param mod.submod.A c:\r\n\t:rtype: A\r\n\t:rtype: mod.A\r\n\t:rtype: mod.submod.A\r\n\r\n.. py:currentmodule:: mod.submod\r\n\r\n.. py:function:: f()\r\n\r\n\t- :py:class:`A`\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.A`\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.submod.A`\r\n\r\n\t:param A a: BUG: links to mod.A instead of mod.submod.A\r\n\t:param mod.A b:\r\n\t:param mod.submod.A c:\r\n\t:rtype: A\r\n\t:rtype: mod.A\r\n\t:rtype: mod.submod.A\r\n```\r\ngives the warnings\r\n```\r\nindex.rst:28: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference 'A': mod.A, mod.submod.A\r\nindex.rst:28: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference 'A': mod.A, mod.submod.A\r\nindex.rst:43: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference 'A': mod.A, mod.submod.A\r\nindex.rst:43: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference 'A': mod.A, mod.submod.A\r\n```\r\nwhich refer to the 4 unqualified type names ``A``.\r\nThe ``:param:`` annotated with ``BUG`` as well as the corresponding ``rtype`` gets resolved to ``mod.A``.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNo warnings, and the two mentioned types should resolve to ``mod.submod.A``.\r\n\r\n**Environment info**\r\n- Sphinx version: tested both with v3.3 and with master\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n\n5. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n6. When editing files, first explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit does not break existing functionality.\n\n7. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. **Reproduce the Issue:**  \n   - Execute the provided test case or script to confirm the presence of the bug. If the script lacks output verification, insert a validation statement (e.g., `assert \"Expected Behavior\" in output`) to ensure full execution.  \n\n2. **Code Investigation:**  \n   - Trace the execution flow using logging or debugging tools. Identify the exact module, function, or line causing the discrepancy. Cross-reference with documentation or API contracts if needed.  \n\n3. **Modification Process:**  \n   - Apply changes incrementally using version-controlled edits. Annotate modifications with comments explaining the rationale behind each adjustment (e.g., \"Fix: Resolved race condition by adding mutex lock\").  \n\n4. **Validation:**  \n   - Re-run the original test alongside regression tests covering related functionality. Include boundary conditions (e.g., empty inputs, extreme values) and parallel execution scenarios if applicable.  \n\n5. **Documentation:**  \n   - Update changelogs or inline documentation to reflect the fix. If the issue reveals a broader architectural weakness, propose a follow-up task to address systemic improvements. \n\n(Open file: )\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$"
