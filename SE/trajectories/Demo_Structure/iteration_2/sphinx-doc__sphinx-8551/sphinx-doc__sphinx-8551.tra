For unqualified names it seems like they search for the name in every (sub)module instead of in the current module and then parent modules.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```rst\r\n.. py:class:: mod.A\r\n.. py:class:: mod.submod.A\r\n\r\n.. py:function:: f()\r\n\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.A`\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.submod.A`\r\n\r\n\t:param mod.A a:\r\n\t:param mod.submod.A b:\r\n\t:rtype: mod.A\r\n\t:rtype: mod.submod.A\r\n\r\n.. py:currentmodule:: mod\r\n\r\n.. py:function:: f()\r\n\r\n\t- :py:class:`A`\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.A`\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.submod.A`\r\n\r\n\t:param A a:\r\n\t:param mod.A b:\r\n\t:param mod.submod.A c:\r\n\t:rtype: A\r\n\t:rtype: mod.A\r\n\t:rtype: mod.submod.A\r\n\r\n.. py:currentmodule:: mod.submod\r\n\r\n.. py:function:: f()\r\n\r\n\t- :py:class:`A`\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.A`\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.submod.A`\r\n\r\n\t:param A a: BUG: links to mod.A instead of mod.submod.A\r\n\t:param mod.A b:\r\n\t:param mod.submod.A c:\r\n\t:rtype: A\r\n\t:rtype: mod.A\r\n\t:rtype: mod.submod.A\r\n```\r\ngives the warnings\r\n```\r\nindex.rst:28: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference 'A': mod.A, mod.submod.A\r\nindex.rst:28: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference 'A': mod.A, mod.submod.A\r\nindex.rst:43: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference 'A': mod.A, mod.submod.A\r\nindex.rst:43: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference 'A': mod.A, mod.submod.A\r\n```\r\nwhich refer to the 4 unqualified type names ``A``.\r\nThe ``:param:`` annotated with ``BUG`` as well as the corresponding ``rtype`` gets resolved to ``mod.A``.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNo warnings, and the two mentioned types should resolve to ``mod.submod.A``.\r\n\r\n**Environment info**\r\n- Sphinx version: tested both with v3.3 and with master\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.

      "thought": "To address the issue described in the PR, we need to understand how Sphinx handles the resolution of unqualified names in `:type:` and `:rtype:` fields. The problem arises when unqualified names like `A` are used in modules where the same name exists in different scopes (e.g., `mod.A` and `mod.submod.A`). The current behavior seems to incorrectly resolve these names, leading to warnings and incorrect links.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Code\nFirst, we need to locate the part of the Sphinx codebase responsible for resolving cross-references in `:type:` and `:rtype:` fields. This likely involves:\n1. The Sphinx domain for Python (`sphinx/domains/python.py`).\n2. The cross-referencing logic in Sphinx (`sphinx/domains/__init__.py` or similar).\n3. The type annotation handling logic.\n\n### Step 2: Reproduce the Error\nWe should create a minimal script or test case that reproduces the issue. This will help us confirm the bug and verify our fix. The script should:\n1. Set up a minimal Sphinx project with the structure described in the PR.\n2. Generate the documentation and capture the warnings.\n\n### Step 3: Modify the Source Code\nBased on the PR description, the fix should ensure that unqualified names in `:type:` and `:rtype:` fields are resolved in the current module's scope first, then parent modules, rather than searching all submodules. This might involve:\n1. Modifying the `resolve_xref` method in the Python domain to handle unqualified names correctly.\n2. Ensuring the `:type:` and `:rtype:` fields use the same resolution logic as explicit cross-references.\n\n### Step 4: Test the Fix\nAfter modifying the code, we should:\n1. Re-run the reproduction script to confirm the warnings are gone.\n2. Verify that the links are correctly resolved to `mod.submod.A` in the problematic cases.\n\n### Step 5: Handle Edge Cases\nWe should consider edge cases such as:\n1. Nested modules with the same class name.\n2. Cases where the unqualified name exists in multiple parent modules.\n3. Cases where the unqualified name is not found in the current module but exists in a parent module.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n1. **Locate the relevant files**: We'll start by exploring the `/testbed` directory to find the files that handle Python domain and cross-referencing logic.\n2. **Reproduce the issue**: We'll create a minimal Sphinx project and document the warnings.\n3. **Modify the code**: We'll adjust the resolution logic to prioritize the current module's scope.\n4. **Test the changes**: We'll re-run the reproduction script and verify the fix.\n\nLet's start by exploring the `/testbed` directory to locate the relevant files.",

It handles prefixes like `.` (current module) and `~` (abbreviated display), but it doesn't explicitly handle the resolution of unqualified names in the context of nested modules.\n2. **`make_xrefs`**: This method splits a type annotation (e.g., `mod.A or mod.submod.A`) into individual targets and processes each one using `make_xref`.\n\n### Problem:\nThe current implementation doesn't enforce the resolution of unqualified names (e.g., `A`) in the current module's scope first. Instead, it may search all submodules indiscriminately, leading to ambiguous references and warnings.\n\n### Solution:\nWe need to modify the `make_xref` method to ensure that unqualified names are resolved in the current module's scope first. This can be done by:\n1. Detecting unqualified names (no `.` in the target).\n2. Using the current module's context (from `env`) to resolve the name locally before falling back to global resolution.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Examine the `env` Parameter**: The `env` parameter (of type `BuildEnvironment`) contains the current module's context.

One approach is to use the `env.ref_context` or the `env.domaindata['py']['modules']` dictionary, which might contain the current module's name.\n2. **Modify `make_xref`**: Adjust the logic to use `env.ref_context` or `env.domaindata` to find the current module's name.\n\nLet's first examine the `env.ref_context` and `env.domaindata` structures to see if they contain the current module's name.

This is exactly what we need to fix the issue.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **`env.ref_context['py:module']` is set**: When resolving unqualified names, the current module's name is available in `env.ref_context['py:module']`. For example:\n   - In the `mod` module, `env.ref_context['py:module']` is `'mod'`.\n   - In the `mod.submod` module, `env.ref_context['py:module']` is `'mod.submod'`.\n\n2. **Resolution Works**: The debug logs confirm that unqualified names are being resolved correctly in the current module's scope (e.g., `A` is resolved to `mod.A` in the `mod` module and to `mod.submod.A` in the `mod.submod` module).\n\n3. **Warnings Persist**: Despite the correct resolution, the warnings about ambiguous references still appear. This suggests that the warnings are being generated elsewhere in the code, possibly after the resolution is done.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Finalize the Fix**: Modify `make_xref` to use `env.ref_context['py:module']` to resolve unqualified names, ensuring the warnings are suppressed.\n2. **Test the Fix**: Rebuild the documentation and confirm that the warnings are gone and the links are correct.\n\n### Final Implementation:\nWe'll update `make_xref` to prioritize `env.ref_context['py:module']` for resolving unqualified names.",
